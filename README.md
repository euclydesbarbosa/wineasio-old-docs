### Revised wine library/driver (it now works) to allow Windows music apps to use ASIO fast audio routed thru JACK1 or JACK2 on Linux
A small bit of prognostication here... the project is underway (as of Apr. 25, 2018) but the driver doesn't work yet.  But it will, and when it does the source and docs will be here in all their glory.  Have a little faith.
