#### The Project (Updated)
The project was started Apr. 18, 2018.  It is now June 29th (vacation over).  The code is written and we're now in clean-up phase.  The driver now works with JACK and JACK2.  When the code is ready for beta release, it will be available on GitHub along with docs--expected within the next two weeks.  We hope to have lots of beta-testers.  Check the **Status Report** on the [Projects](https://github.com/wineasio/wineasio/projects) page.  Thanks for your interest!
