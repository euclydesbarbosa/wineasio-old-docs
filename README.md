### Revised wine library/driver (it now works) to allow Windows music apps to use ASIO fast audio routed thru JACK or JACK2 on Linux
A small bit of prognostication here... the project was started Apr. 18 and is still underway (as of Apr. 25, 2018) but the driver doesn't work yet.  But it will, and when it does the source and docs will be here in all their glory.  Have a little faith and refer to the Status report on the **Projects** tab.  It will be updated frequently.
