### An updated WINE library/driver to allow Windows music apps to use ASIO fast audio routed thru JACK or JACK2 on Linux
A small bit of prognostication here... the project was started Apr. 18, 2018 and is still underway (as of May 1).  It doesn't entirely work yet but it will, and when it does the source and docs will be here in all their glory.  Have a little faith and refer to the Status report on the **Projects** tab.  It will be updated frequently.

#### Update
The driver is outputting clean audio with JACK1 and JACK2!  The worst is over.

"No deadlines, man," says _The Dude_ of the free software world, "you'll get the driver when it _arrives_.  The Dude abides."
