#### The Project
A small bit of prognostication here... the project was started Apr. 18, 2018 and is still underway (as of May 5).  It doesn't entirely work yet but it will, and when it does the source and docs will be here in all their glory.  Have a little faith and refer to the **Status Report** on the [Projects](https://github.com/wineasio/wineasio/projects) page.

#### Update
The driver is outputting clean audio with JACK1 and JACK2.  The worst is over.
