Dear Microsoft,

     We like this site (Github) because its clean, has no bots or advertising and doesn't spam our emails.  Would you kindly follow suit?  We're giving you the benefit of the doubt here.  Maybe you _have_ changed your evil ways.  We'll see.  But blow it, and we'll be gone in a New York nanosecond.  Fair warning.

                                         Sincerely,

                                         
					 The WineASIO Developers

P.S. And please, please, please, don't rename the site "Microsoft GitHub".  We all know by now.
